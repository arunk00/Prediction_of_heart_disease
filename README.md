# preditction_of_heart_disease
This is a machine learning project used to predict whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not .

1. In this prject, First we collected the medical history(dataset) of the patient which consist of 13 attibute such as age,sex,cp etc.

2. Then we trained this dataset using the four algorithm that we used in this project.

3. The 4 algorithm used is 
   1.K-nearest Neighbour
   2.Logistics Regression
   3.Decision Tree
   4.Random forest classifier

4. at last we find accuracy using all four algorithm and also determine whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not by inserting their medical records.
